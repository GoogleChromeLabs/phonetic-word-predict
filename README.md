This browser extension enhances the typing experience by providing real-time word suggestions based on phonetic matching. As a user types, a dedicated UI element (a suggestion bar) appears, displaying potential words that sound similar to the text being entered. Unlike traditional spell checkers that rely on strict letter-by-letter similarity, this extension focuses on how words sound. This means it can effectively suggest the correct word even if the user makes phonetic spelling errors (for example, typing "enuf" might suggest "enough"). This feature aims to help users quickly select their intended word, improving typing speed and accuracy, particularly for those who may spell words based on their pronunciation rather than conventional spelling rules.
This project is particularly focused on the French language phonemic prediction of words.
